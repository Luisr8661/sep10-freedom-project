First I am going to upload my wireframes to my repo.

Next I am going to enable github pages.

Then I will work on the actual website.

The website will consist of 4 crucial steps.

the first is the h1 and context, this will be the simplest step as it is just typing.

The second is working on the images and text describing the images, this will be the hardest step as I tend to have trouble with links to images.

The third is adding my future ideas of technology, this I can just copy paste and separate using P elements.

The fourth and final step is to apply my tool, I'll need to apply it to certain areas (my h1 and h2 as well as my text for the images) when I have the time.
