<h2 class="animate__animated animate__pulse animate__infinite">Future ideas</h2>
<p>-Holograms that allow surgeons to see inside of the patient before operating.</p>

<p>-It would be an adaptive AI (artificial intelligence), growing with the surgeon's skill.</p>


<p>-If the surgeon is known to make mistakes or is new, the AI will warn the surgeon of the risks required during the surgery.</p>


<p>-If the surgeon is highly skilled the AI will only show a hologram of what the surgeon wants to see, it will not warn them of the risks if it has noticed that the surgeon does not make mistakes.</p>


<p>-You can speak to the AI and give it commands or just speak to it casually and have a normal conversation.</p>


<p>-The AI can monitor the patient, it can check for blood pressure, internal bleeding, or even broken bones.</p>


<p>-The AI would eventually grow enough to tell you what is wrong with the patient before you even see the holograms.</p>


<p>-The AI would also be able to deliver anesthesia to the patients by itself, it would need no human input to do this, it would simply detect if there is something internally damaged on the operating table and give it anesthesia.</p>


<p>-The AI would have a VR headset that would allow you to simulate surgeries or during an operation you can look inside of the organs and the hologram would be of what you see instead of what the AI scans.</p>
